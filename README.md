                            Data exploration project.

My first self-driven SQL project. Utalizing Amazon Book dataset by web scraping.
The dataset used can be found on public platform Kaggle.
Author:CHHAVI,Amazon Books Dataset: Genre, Sub-genre, and Books.


The dataset information includes different types of genres, sub-genres, and individual 
books like their titles, authors, prices, and ratings. By exploring this data I hope to 
learn what books, genres are popular, does price has an impact on rating and overall trends
in peoples preferences
